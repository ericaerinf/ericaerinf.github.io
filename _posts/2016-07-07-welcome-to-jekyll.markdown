## I'm Erica ##

# and this my classic "Hello World" moment #

I'm working with [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) this summer in New York as part of a program called the [New York Arts Practicum](http://www.artspracticum.org/). We're a little more than half way through the eight week program right now. As part of this second half, I'm learning how to make *static sites* with Taeyoon to help him create slideshows for his lectures. It's **very** exciting and it's really going to help me in my own work.

   
Some sites/tutorials that are really helping me out:

*  [How to Install Node.js and NPM on a Mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
*  [Jekyll: Basic Usage](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/)
*  [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)
* [Good Resources for Learning Git and GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
* [Configuring Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-jekyll/)
